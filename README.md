# codingDimensionTemplate_Guice

This can be considered as the professional version of [codingDimensionTemplate](https://github.com/xzhuah/codingDimensionTemplate). I pre configured Guice framework in this template for you to use. As I am developing my [CodingDimension](https://github.com/xzhuah/codingDimension), I found it necessary to use some dependency injection framework as the number of Classes increase quickly. Spring is too heavy for individual's project, guice looks like a more suitable solution. So I made this new template for those who need a dependency injection framework.

Actually codingDimensionTemplate is compatible to all types of other frameworks, just need a way to organize it. For Guice, we can take each node as a sub module, the common layer as a another big module, and we provide a global module to install all these module. Some extra work to do is that you need to bind your interface with their impl in the Module and install Module to its parent when you add a new one.
